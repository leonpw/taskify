# Taskify

Taskify is a small browser to-do app. This project shows the capabilities of react, typescript and react-beautiful-dnd. The items are drag and droppable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The icons come from here:
react-icons.github.io/

react-beautiful-dnd from here:
https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd

I got the color palette from here:
